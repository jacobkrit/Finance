**Interest**: The fee paid in exchange for the right to borrow money. There are two main types of interest: Simple and Compound.

- **Simple interest** is a predetermined percentage of the principle that was initially lent to the borrower that the borrower must pay in exchange for access to the funds.  

$$FV=PV*r*n$$  

$FV$: Future Value  
$PV$: Present value (Principal amount)  
$r$: Interest Rate  
$n$: number of periods 

- **Compound Interest** is the interest that is paid that includes both principle and compounding interest (interest on top of the interest).  

$$FV=PV*(1+\frac{r}{t})^{n*t}$$  
$FV$: Future Value  
$PV$: Present value (Principal amount)  
$r$: Interest Rate  
$n$: number of periods 
$t$: times per period
