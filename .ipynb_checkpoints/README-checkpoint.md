### **Compound Interest, Costs, Annuity Formulas and more**


**Interest**: The fee paid in exchange for the right to borrow money. There are two main types of interest: Simple and Compound.

- **Simple interest** is a predetermined percentage of the principle that was initially lent to the borrower that the borrower must pay in exchange for access to the funds.  

$$FV=PV*r*n$$  

$FV$: Future Value  
$PV$: Present value (Principal amount)  
$r$: Interest Rate  
$n$: number of periods 

- **Compound Interest** is the interest that is paid that includes both principle and compounding interest (interest on top of the interest).  

$$FV=PV*(1+\frac{r}{t})^{n*t}$$  

$FV$: Future Value  
$PV$: Present value (Principal amount)  
$r$: Interest Rate  
$n$: number of periods   
$t$: times per period 



**Annuity**: series of payments of a fixed amount for a specified number of periods.
- **Regular Annuity**: End ordinary annuity or annuity in arrears. (Paid at the end)
- **Annuity Due**: Beginning annuity due or annuity in advance (paid at the beginning).
- **Deferred annuity**: first payment is later than first period (paid first later).
- **Perpetuities**: annuities paid forever.


$$FV=PR*\frac{1+\frac{r}{t}^{n*t} -1}{\frac{r}{t}}$$  

$FVA$: Future value Annuity
$PVA$: Present value Annuity
$PR$: Periodic value (value of each payment)
$r$: Annuity Interest Rate
$n$: number of periods 
$t$: times per period
